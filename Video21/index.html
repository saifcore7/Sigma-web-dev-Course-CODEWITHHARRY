    <p>
      CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets. The cascade is the algorithm for
      solving conflicts where multiple CSS rules apply to an HTML element. It's
      the reason that the text of the button styled with the above CSS will be
      purple. Understanding the cascade algorithm helps you understand how the
      browser resolves conflicts like this. The cascade algorithm has 4 distinct
      stages.
      <br />
      1. Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules
      appear. <br />

      2. Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the
      strongest match. <br />
      3. Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether
      that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored
      CSS.
      <br />
      4. Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others,
      especially with the !important rule type.

    Solution To calculate the specificity value of the selector
    a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover, you can break down its components:
    Element selectors: a contributes 1 point. Class selectors: .harryclass and
    .rohan-class each contributes 10 points, totaling 20 points. Attribute
    selector: [href] contributes 10 points. Pseudo-class: :hover adds another 10
    points. Add up all these values: 1 (element) + 20 (classes) + 10 (attribute)
    + 10 (pseudo-class) = 41. So, the specificity value of the selector
    a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover will be 41.
